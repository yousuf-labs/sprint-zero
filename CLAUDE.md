## What is Sprint Zero?

Sprint Zero is a cloneable Claude Code kit that turns a reference URL plus three scoping answers into a complete spec set and a working product. The user points Sprint Zero at something similar to what they want to build, answers one multi-part scoping question, and a team of sub-agents produces:

- A full spec set in `docs/` (scope, reference brief, PRD, decisions, user stories, API contract)
- A working build in `server/` (Express + Supabase) and `client/` (React + Vite)
- Playwright-driven QA covering the auth flow and the core product loops

The audience is PMs, founders, and non-developers who can follow terminal output but don't write code. Every decision in this repo prioritises:

- Clarity over cleverness
- Demo-readiness over production hardening
- Visible outputs over elegant internals
- The user's judgement over inferred defaults

---

## Scope levels

The user picks one of three levels up front. The scope level drives every downstream agent's behaviour.

| Level       | What it produces                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clickable` | Mock backend, fake data, no auth. Useful for pitching and flow reviews.                                           |
| `MVP`       | Real Supabase, real auth, one core loop works end-to-end. The main v1 target.                                     |
| `Prod`      | MVP plus error boundaries, loading states, input validation, and Playwright happy path + one error path per loop. |

`docs/scope.md` is the lever that carries this choice through the pipeline.

---

## The fixed stack

Sprint Zero v1 produces one stack. Not configurable, not inferred.

- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Backend:** Express (Node)
- **Database + Auth:** Supabase (Postgres + Supabase Auth)
- **Testing:** Playwright via Playwright MCP

The user brings their own Supabase project. Credentials go in `.env` (see `.env.example`).

---

## Architecture, one line

URL → scoping conversation → spec set (PRD, decisions, stories, contract) → parallel build (backend + frontend) → QA with browser-driven tests → working product.

Files generated at runtime (per user run):

- `docs/scope.md` — scoping answers, structured
- `docs/reference-brief.md` — extracted brief of the reference URL
- `docs/prd.md` — product requirements
- `docs/decisions.md` — scope cuts and tradeoffs, tied to the chosen level
- `docs/user-stories.md` — user stories
- `docs/api-contract.md` — the contract all agents build to
- `server/` — Express + Supabase build
- `client/` — React + Vite build
- `.claude/settings.local.json` — demo-time permissive settings, gitignored

## Agent topology

Sprint Zero's build layer has four sub-agents. One orchestrator, two engineers, one QA. The user talks to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles everything else.

```
User
  │
  └─ tech-lead ──┬─ backend-engineer   (Express + Supabase)
                 ├─ frontend-engineer  (React + Vite + Supabase Auth)
                 │
                 └─ qa-engineer        (Playwright MCP)
```

### tech-lead

- Reads `docs/prd.md`, `docs/api-contract.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, and `docs/scope.md`
- Briefs the user on what it understood
- Spawns `backend-engineer` and `frontend-engineer` in parallel in a single turn
- Waits for both, then spawns `qa-engineer`
- Returns a delivery summary
- Does not write application code

### backend-engineer

- Builds the Express API in `server/`
- Uses `@supabase/supabase-js` for data access
- JWT verification middleware on protected routes
- Seed script uses the Supabase admin client
- Builds strictly to `docs/api-contract.md`

### frontend-engineer

- Builds the React app in `client/` using Vite
- Supabase Auth: login page, signup page, session context, protected route wrapper
- Product screens come from `docs/user-stories.md` and the contract
- Form patterns standardised so QA can drive them

### qa-engineer

- Runs the full auth dance (signup, session, logout, login, protected route, 401 on expired token)
- Runs the core product loop end-to-end
- At `Prod` scope, adds one error-path test per loop
- Reports pass/fail back to `tech-lead`

## Key files Claude Code should read first

When starting a session on this repo, read in this order:

1. `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — project context and rules
2. `plan.md` — what's built, what's next, what's out of scope
3. `README.md` — the public-facing story, to stay consistent with it

When a user invokes `/sprint-zero <url>`, the orchestrator adds:

4. `docs/scope.md` (once scoping is complete)
5. `docs/prd.md`
6. `docs/api-contract.md`
7. `docs/decisions.md`

---

## Rules for all agents

1. **The API contract is law.** `docs/api-contract.md` is the shared interface. Backend implements it. Frontend consumes it. QA validates against it. If it's wrong or missing, stop and flag it — do not work around it silently.
2. **Read the scope file.** `docs/scope.md` tells you which of the three levels you're building for. Calibrate your output to that level. Do not add polish above the chosen level.
3. **Keep files small and readable.** Non-developers will read this. Someone may record a Loom over it.
4. **No TypeScript unless the scope file says so.** Plain JavaScript by default.
5. **No exotic dependencies.** If it needs its own README to install, pick something simpler.
6. **Seed data must be realistic.** Real-sounding names, companies, and records. Not "Test User 1".
7. **Every endpoint returns consistent JSON.** Structure defined in `docs/api-contract.md`.
8. **Log decisions.** If you make a tradeoff, add a line to `docs/decisions.md`.
9. **Narrate handoffs.** Orchestrator and engineers: never go silent for long stretches. The user is watching.
10. **Do less when in doubt.** A working 80% at the chosen scope beats a broken 100%.

## Conventions

- Sentence case for headings in markdown, not Title Case.
- No emoji in technical output.
- Prose over bullet lists unless structure genuinely helps.
- Numbered steps when sequence matters; otherwise prose.
- One idea per paragraph.

---

## Context for Claude Code

- Builder: Yousuf Alvi (co-facilitator on Hamza Farooq's Claude Code for PMs cohort)
- Audience for this repo: PMs and non-developers using Claude Code
- This repo's own build is tracked in `plan.md`, phase by phase. Each phase is a single chat session. Do not skip ahead.
- Mini Twenty is Sprint Zero's worked example (Phase 5). Until then, `examples/` is intentionally empty.

---

## Build orchestration pattern

Sprint Zero uses a two-tier pattern that respects Claude Code's sub-agent limitations:

- `tech-lead` is a **briefing sub-agent** — reads specs, returns a build brief, does NOT spawn engineers
- The **main Claude Code session** is the orchestrator — spawns backend-engineer and frontend-engineer in parallel, then qa-engineer after both complete
- `backend-engineer`, `frontend-engineer`, `qa-engineer` are **worker sub-agents** — isolated context, no sub-agent spawning themselves

When running a build, invoke tech-lead first for the brief, then follow the recommended execution order it returns.
