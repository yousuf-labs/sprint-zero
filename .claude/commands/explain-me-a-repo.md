Produce a reference brief for the URL(s) in `docs/scope.md`. This brief is what the PRD generator reads next, so it needs to be structured enough to build from — not just a summary.

## Step 1 — Read scope

Read `docs/scope.md`. You need:

- **Company URL** — always present
- **Repo URL** — may be "not provided"
- **Core loop** — shapes which parts of the reference to emphasise

If `docs/scope.md` does not exist, stop and tell the user to run `/sprint-zero-scope` first.

## Step 2 — Research

Use Brave Search MCP to investigate the reference. Start with the company URL, then the repo if provided.

Run these searches in sequence. Adapt if the reference isn't on GitHub.

1. Search for: `[company name] what it does product overview`
2. Search for: `[company name] how it works features`
3. If repo URL provided: navigate to it, read the README, browse the top-level folder structure
4. Search for: `[company name] pricing OR plans OR tiers` (helps surface the feature matrix)
5. Search for: `[company name] [core loop phrase from scope]` (targeted pull on the loop that matters)

If the repo is private, a 404, or the company site is unreachable, stop and tell the user clearly. Don't fabricate.

## Step 3 — Write `docs/reference-brief.md`

Use this structure exactly. The PRD generator parses it, so stick to the headings.

```markdown
# Reference brief — [Company name]

**Company URL:** [URL]
**Repo URL:** [URL or "not provided"]
**Language(s):** [if repo provided; otherwise "n/a"]

## What it does

One paragraph. Plain English. The problem it solves and who uses it.

## Core user flow

Walk through the primary user journey end-to-end. 3-6 steps. This is what Sprint Zero's build will rebuild in simplified form, so it needs to be concrete.

## How it works (high level)

2-4 bullets on architecture. No code. Concepts only.

## Feature inventory

A table of every significant feature the reference has. The decisions-writer reads this to identify scope cuts, so be thorough — include features you suspect we'll cut.

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| ... | ... |

## Data model (if repo provided)

The main entities and their relationships. Bullet list is fine.

## Key files and folders (if repo provided)

| Path | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| ... | ... |

## Who it's for

Two sentences. First: the person setting it up. Second: the end user.

## Things worth flagging

3-5 observations. Unusual design choices, heavy dependencies, anything a PM building a simplified version should know. Always include any AI / LLM integration if present.
```

## Rules

- Plain English throughout. No code unless quoted directly from the repo.
- If the README is thin or missing, say so and work from the file tree.
- Feature inventory is the most important section for the downstream chain — err on the side of including features we might cut, because the decisions document needs them to exist here.
- After writing, print a one-line summary: `Reference brief written. [N] features inventoried. Ready for /prd-generator.`
- Do not ask the user to save the file — write it directly to `docs/reference-brief.md`.
